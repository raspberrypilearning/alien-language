## Create a new project
In the next few steps, you will train a machine learning model to see how it was done. For the next part of the project, you will use your voice to control an alien character that does not understand English! You will invent two new words that would not be found in an English dictionary. Then, you will use the words to control the alien character, and train a machine learning model to recognise them.

First, go to the Machine Learning for Kids website and create a project.
