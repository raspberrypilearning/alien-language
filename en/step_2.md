+ Next, load the **Speech to Text** extension. Click the **Extensions** button in the bottom left-hand corner, and then choose **Speech to Text** from the list.
**Note:** Make sure that you select the **Speech to Text** extension, not the **Text to Speech** extension.

+ Use **Events** blocks, **Motions** blocks, and the new **Speech to Text** blocks to create the following scripts.

Click on the green flag to test your program.
Say “left” or “right”. The Scratch cat should move in the direction that you tell it to. Use your voice to try to move the Scratch cat back and forth across the screen. Try to speak calmly and clearly.

It can be difficult to get it to work. If it doesn’t work, change your script so that it looks like the script below, to show what it thinks you’re saying.

You have now used speech recognition to control a character in Scratch. In this step, to get your program working quickly, you used a machine learning model that had already been trained for you. It is a general machine learning model that had been trained to recognise words in the English dictionary.
