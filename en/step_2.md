+ Next, load the **Speech to Text** extension. Click the **Extensions** button in the bottom left-hand corner, and then choose **Speech to Text** from the list.
**Note:** Make sure that you select the **Speech to Text** extension, not the **Text to Speech** extension.

Click on the green flag to test your program.
Say “left” or “right”. The Scratch cat should move in the direction that you tell it to. Use your voice to try to move the Scratch cat back and forth across the screen. 
It can be difficult to get it to work. Try to speak calmly and clearly. If it doesn’t work, modify your script, as seen below, to show what it thinks you’re saying.

You have now used speech recognition to control a character in Scratch. To get this working quickly, you have used a machine learning model that has already been trained for you. This is a general machine learning model that has been trained to recognise words in the English dictionary.
