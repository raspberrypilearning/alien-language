## Create alien words
In this step, you will invent your alien words.

--- task ---

You need two words — an alien word for “left” and an alien word for “right”. Invent two new words that would not be in an English dictionary. They can be random noises, as long as you can repeat them in the same way every time and they are recognisably different from each other. If you don’t want to make noises with your voice, that’s okay — you can find other ways to make noises. You can click your fingers, clap your hands, squeeze a squeaky toy, or do anything else you can think of! Just make sure that you remember your new words!

+ Click the **Train** button to start to collect examples. ![Arrow pointing to the train button](images/click-train.png)

+ Click the **Add example** button in the **background noise** bucket. Recording background noise will help your machine learning model to tell the difference between the sounds that you will train it to recognise, and the background noise where you are. ![Arrow pointing to the add example button](images/background-noise-annotated.png)

+ Click on the microphone to record 2 seconds of background noise. ![Arrow pointing to microphone button](images/add-example-annotated.png)

+ Click the **Add** button to save your recording. ![Arrow pointing to add button](images/save-example-annotated.png)

+ Repeat those steps until you have **at least 8 examples** of background noise. ![bucket filled with 8 background examples](images/8-background.png)

+ Click the **Add new label** button in the top right-hand corner, and create a new training bucket called `left`. ![Arrow pointing to the add new label button](images/8-background-annotated.png)

+ Click the **Add example** button in the new **left** bucket. ![Arrow pointing to the add example button](images/left-empty-annotated.png)

+ Click the **Add new label** button in the top right-hand corner again, and create a new training bucket called `right`.

+ Click the **Add example** button in the new **right** bucket.

+ Record **at least 8 examples** of your alien word for “right”. ![bucket filled with 8 right examples](images/8-right.png)

+ **Note:** By the end of this step, you must have eight examples in each of the three buckets.
